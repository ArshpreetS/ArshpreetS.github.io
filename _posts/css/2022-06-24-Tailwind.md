# Somethings should be done

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

# Background

## `background-image`
> Use `url()` as value to refer to the image

This property allows to add an image as a background.

## `background-size`
Specifies the size of the background images.
**Note**: A special value is *cover* which allows to cover the whole container


# Custom Properties (variables)

## Defining Variables
```css
:root {
    --main-bg-color: brown;
}
```

## To access variables
```CSS
p {
    background-color: var(--main-bg-color);
}

```

# Pseudo Elements

## `:after`

This is used to get anything just after the targeted element.

## `:before`

This is used to get anything just before the targeted element.

# At-Rules

## Media Queries `@media`


# FlexBox

When we define a div as *flex* becomes the *flex container* and the child elements becomes *flex items*

By default, the flex items are ordered along the row.

## flex-direction: Change the axis
> Default value: row

`flex-direction: column;`

## flex-wrap: Wrapping child elements
> To wrap child elements within the flex box

`flex-wrap: wrap;` -> This allows to wrap the child elements within flexbox

## flex: Define the amount of space the flex items will take
> This is the property of flex items

`flex: 1;` if given to all elements then the space taken is equal


# Horizontal and Vertical Alignment

![Alignment](../../assets/img/css/flex/flex_terms.png)

We can align items along the main axis and cross axis.

To align items along **cross axis** => `align-items: center;`
To align items along **main axis** => `justify-content: center;`

*Note*: Other values are `flex-start` and `flex-end`

## Order

We can change the order of the `flex-items` using the `order` property:

By default, all the flex-items has the order 0. The higher the value the right
it is.


There are two types of intrinsic size:
1. Instrinsic Max size:
2. Instrinsic Min size:

- flex-grow: (default value = 0): It allows to take up the extra space and evenly distribute the space among the elements inside of it.

- flex-shrink: (default value = 1):
    - **1**: It allows the elements to shrink to its *Intrinsic min size*.
    - **0**: It doesn't allow the elements to shrink from its *intrinsic max size*.


# Grid

## `grid-template-columns`
> `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr` This allows to create three
equally spaced columns

**NEW UNIT**: `fr` -> represents a fraction of the available space

## `gap`
> specifies the gap between the elements

## `grid-template-rows`
> `grid-template-rows: 200px 200px` This allow to change the rows size explicitly

Suppose I want to set a minimum row size to be 100px but increase it to fit the content inside.

`grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px,auto)` -> defines the row size to be 100px minimum and auto allows it to increase to fit the content size.

## `grid-template-areas`

```CSS

div { grid-template-areas:
            "a a a"
            "b c c"
            "b c c";
          }
```
This basically sets up a grid like the way it says (using elements a,b,c);

We can give these names to the elements we want to place in the grid using the command `grid-area: 'a'`
